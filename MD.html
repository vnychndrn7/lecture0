			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>
				McDonnell Douglas was formed in the 1967 merger of the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, founded in 1939, and the Douglas Aircraft Company, established in 1921. The latter’s founder, Donald W. Douglas (1892–1981), first became interested in aviation as a youth while watching the Wright Brothers demonstrate their biplane for the Army in 1909. Later, as a civil engineering assistant at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s department of aerodynamics, he helped devise one of the first wind tunnels for the testing of aircraft. In 1920 he designed the Cloudster, the first aerodynamically streamlined plane, and founded his company to fill an order for three of the planes for the U.S. Navy.			
				The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 is a wide-body airliner manufactured by American McDonnell Douglas (MDD) and later by Boeing. Following DC-10 development studies, the program was launched on December 30, 1986. Assembly of the first prototype began on March 9, 1988, it rolled out in September 1989 and made its maiden flight on January 10, 1990. FAA certification was achieved on November 8, the first delivery was to Finnair on December 7, and it entered service on the 20th.
				It retains the basic trijet configuration of the DC-10 with updated GE CF6-80C2 or PW4000 turbofans. It has a slightly wider wing with winglets and its MTOW was increased by 14% to 630,500 lb (286 t). Its fuselage is stretched by 11% to 202 ft (61.6 m) to accomodate 298 passengers in three classes over a range of up to 7,130 nmi (13,200 km). It features a glass cockpit that eliminates the need for a flight engineer. It failed to meet its range and fuel burn targets, 200 were built until the last in October 2000, after Boeing took over MDD in 1997. While some were initially built as freighters, many were converted and most are used in cargo airlines.

			<h3>Operators</h3>
			<p>
				As of July 2019, the worldwide fleet of MD-11s totals 118 aircraft in commercial service with cargo operators FedEx Express (55), UPS Airlines (37), Lufthansa Cargo (12), Western Global Airlines (11) and other operators with fewer aircraft.[30]

				Most of the airlines who ordered the MD-11 for their long-haul passenger flights had replaced it with Airbus A330, A340, and Boeing 777 aircraft by the end of 2004. Some carriers converted their MD-11s to freighters such as China Eastern Airlines and Korean Air. Korean Air announced as early as December 1994 its intention to convert its five passenger MD-11s to freighters for medium-range cargo routes.[31] In 1995, American Airlines agreed to sell its 19 aircraft to FedEx, with the first MD-11 being transferred in 1996.[32] Japan Airlines (JAL) announced the replacement of its 10 MD-11s in 2000; these aircraft were being converted into freighters and sold to UPS in 2004.[2]

				In February 2007, TAM Linhas Aéreas began operating the first of three leased passenger MD-11s, in a deal arranged by Boeing as an interim solution for TAM to quickly be able to operate newly granted intercontinental routes while waiting for four Boeing 777-300ERs to be delivered from late 2008.[33] The last MD-11 was retired from TAM's fleet in July 2009, which ended its use by Brazilian airlines (Varig, VASP, and TAM).
